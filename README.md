# Time Tracker Codex

A simple time tracking web application built with React and TypeScript.

## Development

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The entry file `index.html` is located in the repository root, so visiting
   `http://localhost:3000/` after running the dev server will load the
   application.
3. Run tests
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The application stores data in your browser `localStorage`.
Click "Start" next to a project to begin tracking time. When a project is running a "Stop" button lets you end the timer.
