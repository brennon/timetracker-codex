## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for all source code.
- Use React functional components and hooks.
- Store persistent data in `localStorage`.
- Keep components small and focused on a single concern.
- Write BDD style tests with `jest` and `jest-cucumber`.
- Run `npm test` before committing.
- Run `npm run lint` if available.
- Document new features in `README.md`.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Summaries must reference changed files with markdown links.
- Include a Testing section describing test commands and results.
